# Hand-Gestures-Classification
This repository belongs to my first homework in **Deep Learning** graduate course (EE25-647) at [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).

Our task was to design an MLP network and train/test it on [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist). We also examined the effects of dropout and batch normalization on accuracy and used `tensorboard` for visualizations.

P.S.

- We had to do our implementations using `tensorflow 1.xx`.
- `requirments.txt` is automatically generated using `conda list -e > requirements.txt`.
